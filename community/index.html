         <h1> <u>The Spring Garden.</u> </h1>
         <p>Located just north of Center City Philadelphia, The Spring Gardens Community Garden allows 180 neighborhood families to come together, garden, and voluntarily maintain an entire block of open green space.

           The Spring Gardens was built by neighbors from the ground up starting in 1995 and helps families grow food and flowers for themselves and for donation through two large City Harvest sections. The garden serves as an outdoor classroom hosting cooking workshops, gardening classes, school education tours, farm bike tours, and provides hands-on learning for student interns, visitors and volunteer groups.</p>
